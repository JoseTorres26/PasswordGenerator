Challenge 3 of UCF Bootcamp.
Password Generator.
Started challenge by adding variables(const characters) and set up first prompt. then i set an if else statement to determine user input. after verifying user input is within range, if statements were added to ask the user what characters they want to include. then i set the selectedCharacters variable to add the characters to. then the generatePassword function was set up randomizing the characters based on input. then confirm statements were put in variables to make an if statement to varify at least one set of characters were included. lastly i reset the value for the selectedCharacters variable so generated passwords include only  user preferred characters.
